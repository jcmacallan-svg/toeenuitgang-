VEVA Trainer baseline v7.3.8

Fixes in this build:
- Student speech ALWAYS appears as the Student bubble (soldier avatar).
- Visitor speech ALWAYS appears as the Visitor bubble (headshot avatar).
- Newest message appears at the TOP and pushes older messages DOWN (max 4; bottom 2 fade).
- Automatic cache-busting loader: always fetches fresh config.js/app.js (unless you force ?v=...).
- Version pill + console show BUILD version + short asset token.
