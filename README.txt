VEVA Trainer baseline v2

Changes:
- Visitor avatar is ALWAYS the same file as the ID headshot (1:1 sync).
- Student avatar uses assets/soldier.png (your existing file).

Required assets in your repo:
- assets/soldier.png
- assets/headshots/headshot_01.png ... headshot_10.png

Notes:
- The visitor avatar automatically switches to the currently generated headshot.
